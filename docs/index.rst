Piste on Piste
==============

If you're looking for a new take on **three-player snooker rules**, and a
**scoreboard app** to go with them, you've found the right place.

Read the :ref:`rules-en`, or the Finnish translation :ref:`rules-fi`.

Launch the latest release of the `Piste on Piste scoreboard app`_.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application. After launching,
internet connection is not required. All state is stored in browser local
storage only, and never sent anywhere. The app currently works best in tablet
size screens in landscape.

There's a rudimentary :ref:`manual` for the app, covering the basics.

.. note::

   The saved games might not work across scoreboard app versions. If you start a
   game using one version of the app, please finish it using the same
   version. The app version is visible in the URL.
